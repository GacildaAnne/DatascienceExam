# DatascienceExam

This repository is for my exam project in Data Science, concerning heart attack prediction. 
The repository includes code for building, training, and testing several classifiers (RandomForest and XGBoost models), as well as a few plots to explore the data + the main paper which is the document that is handed in for the exam.
